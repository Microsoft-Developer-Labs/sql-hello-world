# Hello World in SQL
Feel free to copy and share.

SQL is super easy, as long as you know how to use it. This language also helps databases for websites.

There is a program that lets you run SQL no problem.

# MySQL

## How do you make MySQL work?
First few steps are simple.

[Download MySQL Now](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)

[Download MariaDB Now](https://downloads.mariadb.org/)

After you download these files, run the mariadb server file, create everything that is needed, then run the MySQL Workbench file. After they both install and they're good to go, enter the local instance on port 3306 (or whatever you put it to). Then just script SQL!
